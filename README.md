# ReportLab-Print-Label-Maker
Makes labels using reportlab module

A project needed labels for printing that included a front and back tags.

This program takes a single excel sheet and reads it using pandas, then uses the information on the sheet to generate labels, where each label had a set amount of times it needed to be replicated, along with descriptions, pricing information, and so on. 


Hopefully you'll find this useful as I only found two other examples out there on how to use reportlab in this use case.
